# Project Tic Tac Toe

## A pixel themed Tic Tac Toe classic in-the-browser!

You get to choose whether to play against a friend or AI. Whatever path you take, your main goal will always be to beat your opponent head on. 

This Tic Tac Toe project has features which include:

* The ability to choose an opponent, a friend or AI.
* The ability to choose the kind of mode (i.e. Easy) you want for the AI.
* The ability to choose and start with either mark "X" or "O".
* The ability to see a win or tie when the game ends at certain conditions.
* The ability to switch between light or dark theme.

*At the time of writing 09/17/2022*, the easy AI mode is the only AI working at the moment. Hopefully I would be able to come back more experienced and complete both medium and hard AI modes. Stay tuned!
